# Description

This is a data visualization project where I built a dashboard that shows the impact of COVID-19 on different US states (and territories) and their corresponding responses. This is an end-to-end project: 1) data extraction from <a href="https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/raw-data">COVID-19 Open Data Source</a> and data preprocessing in Jupyter Notebook using Python, 2) Staging and Loading the processed data into tables in a Snowflake database and 3) Writing custom queries, defining logical relationships between tables and building an interative dashboard in Tableau.
<br><br>
The interactive dashboard has been shared to Tableau Public and can be accessed <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nay.zaw.aung.win/viz/Covid-19InDifferentUSStates/COVIDDASHBOARD?publish=yes">HERE</a>.
